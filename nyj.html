            Unsealing the challenging yet hospitable government through the eyes of a then 9-year-old Trevor Noah as he describes the life he had growing up in a society that did not acknowledge his very existence.
            From being a mixed child amidst the threatening aisle of the British colonialists and their endearing racist and segregative policies called apartheid. 
            These entirely exposed young Noah to racism, segregation amidst violent crimes, extreme poverty and violence even amongst themselves in the name of codling up with all these harsh conditions of living.
            From being poorly labelled from the second-hand vehicle, harassed by a bus driver to almost being kidnapped which led to Noah being exposed to extreme dangers despite the delicate age he was at.

        <h3><i><strong>These are some of the challenges I thought should be addressed.</strong></i></h3><br>

            <strong>Devotion</strong> to Christianity versus the African traditional society is often termed as a way to civilization. To date, various collisions have led to disagreements between the two sectors as Ugandans try to adapt to the white manâ€™s religion whilst being born amidst the norms of their ancestors.<br>
            <strong>Poverty</strong>continues to draw the line in the social lives of many Ugandans. It further creates division in all sectors of life. For example education, location of residence(slums) quality of service.<br>
            <strong>Platonic and non-platonic</strong> relationships coexist e.g. mother-child, mom-dad, and grandmother-grandchild are typical in all cultures. Forbidden bonds by cultures e.g. between races are still a centre of conflict.<br>
            <strong>Insecurity</strong> even in the fast-developing nation still stands out. Crime, kidnapping, rape and harassment still threaten the lives of many Ugandans, especially the children and women who stand out as the weak side of society
